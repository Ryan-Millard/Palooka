# Security Policy for Palooka

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Since **Palooka** is a small ESP32 robot with custom hardware, most bugs and vulnerabilities are low-risk. You can report them directly in the [Issues](https://github.com/Ryan-Millard/Palooka/issues) section of this repository.

When reporting a vulnerability, please include:

- A clear description of the problem.
- Steps to reproduce it (if applicable).
- Any relevant hardware details (board version, firmware, connected components).

Maintainers will review and respond as quickly as possible, and issues will be prioritized based on impact and severity.

## Supported Versions

| Version | Status |
| ------- | ------ |
| `main` (latest) | Supported |
| Previous releases | Security fixes may be limited; please upgrade to the latest version. |

## Notes

- This policy is meant to streamline handling of bugs and low-risk vulnerabilities for hobbyists.
- For serious security issues that could affect other users if disclosed publicly, contact the maintainers directly via email at: millardryandevon@gmail.com
